# CublexCore
Modular API foundation for Cublex Labs plugins, centralizing core functions to simplify maintenance and reduce overall plugin size.

---
### Plugins using this library:
- CubDialogs as of 2.x version
- CubWorlds as of 2.x version

---
### Installation:
- Download, drop it in the plugins folder, and you are done.
- Additionally, you can change the auto-updater feature in the config file if you don't want it to be automatically updated.

---
### Core Features:
- üåç **Native Localization:** Supports YAML-based i18n with `{placeholders}`, automatic fallback to the `{default-language}`
- üßæ **Centralized Log and Debug System:** Missing keys, fallback events, and in-game log viewing
- üìå **Placeholders:** Dynamic placeholders like {player}, {world}, {coins}, etc. and static placeholders from config.yml like {server-name}, {discord}, etc.

### Config.yml Example üîß
```yaml
# Static variables. These cannot be changed during runtime. You must stop the server to make changes here
server-name: cublex.net
fallback-language: en # it is used when the player's client locale is not supported
logging-enabled: false # enable/disable logging into a separate file under /plugins/Corlex folder (universal)
restful-enabled: false # enable/disable REST API on your server. Check https://dev.cublex.net/wiki/corlex/rest
debug-mode: false # enable/disable DEBUG mode

# Variables (as placeholders) that are used in the localization strings
prefix: "#ffc13b[CublexCore] &r"
test-prefix: "&c[CublexCore] &r"
discord: "https://discord.gg/Hqq3CdnenN" # Chat and announcements
telegram: "" # Announcements and replies
mobile-app: "" # In-app purchases and spending shop
```

---
### üß™ Example API Usage

```java
CorlexAPI api = Bukkit.getServicesManager().load(CorlexAPI.class);
api.send(player, "corlex.welcome", Map.of("world", "Wilderness"));
```
Because corlex.welcome has {prefix}, {player} and {world} placeholders. First 2 is filled by the program, and the last one given by the call.
```
corlex:
  welcome: "{prefix}Welcome, {player}! You are in {world}."
```

---
### Future Plans
- /cublex log recent command
- Client-side item-lore support for extreme localization
- GUI API (paged layouts, close/back buttons, border styles)
- Auto-merging of locale files on update
- Plugin usage metrics
- Announcement API (Game, Discord)
- AI module
- Use arguments in the permission-error message. Interaction or command error
- Format commands help into clickable TextComponents
- Paginate the output of help command for more commands
- Auto-suggest when the user types an invalid command
- Add force-default-language boolean
